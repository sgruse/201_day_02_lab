Lab for January 6th, 2016

For this lab I created three questions with a bonus question.  Within this lab I tested my knowledge of while loops and even tried a stretch statement.  This lab folder contains an index.html document and an app.js page for my JavaScript.  

updated: 1/8/16 (Luc):
added functions in an array, called by a for loop. Left number guessing alone and switch statement alone.

update half an hour later: 1/8/16 (Luc)
added css colors, and added links at bottom of page

This is another update to my guessing game on 1/9/16.  I tightened up both my JavaScript and HTML code to make them follow convention and appear easier to read.  I also changed the link to my partner, Luc's guessing game, as instructed by my TA.
